Quiz Application

## Introduction

This project is a Java-based command-line quiz application developed for a college assignment. The application allows users to log in as either an Admin or a regular User. Admins have access to functionalities such as managing quiz questions, options, and answers, while Users can participate in quizzes and receive scorecards.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in as either an Admin or a regular User.
- **Admin Functionalities**:
  - Create, modify, and delete quiz questions.
  - Manage options and correct answers for each question.
- **User Functionalities**:
  - Participate in quizzes with fixed time limits.
  - Modify selected answers before the timer expires.
- **Timer Functionality**: Initiates a timer with a fixed time limit for quizzes.
- **Scorecard Generation**: Automatically generates a PDF scorecard for Users after completing a quiz.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/java-quiz-app.git
```

2. Compile the Java files:

```bash
cd java-quiz-app
javac *.java
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
java Main
```

4. Follow the prompts to log in as either an Admin or a User, and navigate through the application's functionalities accordingly.

## Dependencies

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed on your machine to compile and run the Java files.
- **PDFBox**: This application uses Apache PDFBox to generate PDF scorecards. You can download PDFBox from [here](https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi) and include it in your project's dependencies.

## Future Enhancements

As this project is developed for educational purposes, there are several areas where it can be improved:

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected inputs or system failures gracefully.
- **Security Features**: Enhance user authentication and data validation to ensure the security of the application.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more user-friendly experience.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate a database to store quiz questions, user data, and scores persistently.
- **Additional Features**: Implement features such as leaderboards, multiple-choice question banks, and randomized quizzes to enhance the application's functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions to this college project are not accepted as it's meant for educational purposes. However, students are encouraged to study the code, understand its implementation, and propose improvements for learning purposes.
